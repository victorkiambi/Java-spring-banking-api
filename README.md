### Objective

Your assignment is to build an internal API for a fake financial institution using Java and any framework.

### Brief

While modern banks have evolved to serve a plethora of functions, at their core, banks must provide certain basic features. Today, your task is to build the basic HTTP API for one of those banks! Imagine you are designing a backend API for bank employees. It could ultimately be consumed by multiple frontends (web, iOS, Android etc).

### Tasks

- Implement assignment using:
  - Language: **Java**
  - Framework: **any framework**
- There should be API routes that allow them to:
  - Create a new bank account for a customer, with an initial deposit amount. A
    single customer may have multiple bank accounts.
  - Transfer amounts between any two accounts, including those owned by
    different customers.
  - Retrieve balances for a given account.
  - Retrieve transfer history for a given account.
- Write tests for your business logic
